# Repo Voice

Communicate with GitHub repositories via Alexa.

## Usage

Repo Voice allows you to communicate with Alexa in the following ways:

### Favorites

`Alexa ask Repo Voice for updates on my favorites` - Get updates on a list of favorites you set.

`Alexa tell Repo Voice to add favorite node` - Add a favorite to your favorites list.

`Alexa tell Repo Voice to remove favorite node` - Remove a favorite to your favorites list.

`Alexa ask Repo Voice what are my favorites` - Get a list of your current favorites.

`Alexa ask Repo Voice for updates on node` - Get updates for the node repository.

## Limitations

Right now this Alexa skill is limited to a [set of repositories](https://github.com/tlovett1/repo-voice/blob/master/lambda/custom/data/repos.json). Feel free to add new ones via a PR.
